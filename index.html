                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I plan and coordinate the testing activities for Web and API applications, ensuring the highest quality standards and performance metrics. I have over 3+ years of experience in software testing and 5+ years of experience in software development, I have a bachelor's degree in computer science, ISTQB certificate and multiple certifications in test automation tools and frameworks. I have created a Selenium, Selenide and Playwright frameworks with Java from scratch, implementing test cases to increase test coverage and test efficiency. I have performed dockerize environment for test executions as built in. I have also performed various types of functional and non-functional testing, such as smoke, regression, positive, negative, boundary value analysis, stress, load, and spike testing.</p>
                <p>I can use k6 and Jmeter as a performance tool to simulate virtual user scenarios and measure the system's response. I leverage Jenkins, GitHub actions continuous integration, Jira Xray for project management, and GitHub and other platforms of version control and collaboration.</p>
